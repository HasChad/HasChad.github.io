## About Me

I have a strong passion for programming and game development, constantly striving to expand my knowledge by exploring new programming languages and game engines. This pursuit allows me to enhance my skills and gain a comprehensive understanding of diverse approaches to game development. Additionally, I possess a keen interest in drawing and animation, which enables me to create my own sprites whenever I embark on a game development project.
