  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I have a strong passion for programming and game development, constantly striving to expand my knowledge by exploring new programming languages and game engines.
  This pursuit allows me to enhance my skills and gain a comprehensive understanding of diverse approaches to game development. Additionally, I possess a keen interest
  in drawing and animation, which enables me to create my own sprites whenever I embark on a game development project.</p>

  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/HasChad/bevy-shooting-range">Bevy Shooting Range</a></h2>
  <p>This is an FPS shooting range game I made with Rust using Bevy game engine. Except gun models, I made the whole weapon mechanics and animations. I developed this game with agile and prototype methodology, and still developing.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/HasChad/first-person-hopper">First Person Hopper</a></h2>
  <p>2D FPS game made with Rust using Bevy game engine. I made this game for understanding and learning Bevy engine and it helped me a lot. Game inspired from LONEWOLF - "Kick Ups Pistol" game mode. I drew the assets including M4 (rifle) and hand.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/HasChad/macro-sand">Macro-Sand</a></h2>
